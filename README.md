# Quake: The Quantum Snake Game
**Superposition, Entanglement, and Teleportation; it’s time for everyone to become a physicist!**

By: Aidan Hopp, Siddharth, and Ramya Iyer

## Introduction
Our game is a new take on everyone’s favorite classic, [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). Our twist comes with the introduction of quantum properties like superposition and entanglement.

## Mechanics
In this game, the bits of food are actually quantum particles that can have a negative or positive state. The game starts out with two quantum particles whose states are unknown; however, once a particle is consumed by the snake, the state of both particles is determined because they were entangled.  A negative state decreases the length of the snake by 1 while the positive state increases its length by 1. In our version, the goal isn’t to become the largest snake. Instead, players achieve the highest score by surviving the longest. Additionally, every six seconds new quantum particles appear on the map, erasing existing ones, and if the snake hasn’t consumed at least 1 particle, wormholes will appear that connect the locations of the two particles that weren’t consumed. Ultimately, as time progresses, the entire screen will fill with wormholes, and the snake is more likely to crash into a wall or itself. No one can go forever. How long can you last?

## Future Additions
We plan to implement a system where if the snake hasn’t consumed at least 1 particle, wormholes will appear that connect the locations of the two particles that weren’t consumed. This would allow the snake to teleport through the wormholes. Ultimately, as time progresses, the entire screen would fill with wormholes, and the snake is more likely to crash into a wall and itself. Additionally, we hope to improve the graphics of the game to make it more visually appealing and incorporate animations for the quantum particles. Finally, we aim to connect the quantum particles in the game to IBM Quantum Machines through the Python package Qiskit so the states of the quantum particles in the game are simulated by real quantum machines.

## Final Notes
Our team had a great time learning and collaborating together. In the future, we hope to implement future changes to the game and make it more functional and interesting.
